# Weekend Jquery Server Calculator 

## Description

_Duration: 2 Days_

Directly above this is how long it took you to develop the project. Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it? 

This project is a fully functional calculator with subtraction, addition, multiplication, and division. Prior calculator entries and solutions were stored on a server using node.js POST and GET functionality along with ajax.  This project took approximately 8 hours to complete at recommended base code functionality.
